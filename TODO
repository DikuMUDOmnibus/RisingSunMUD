GEOFF'S TO DO LIST
+-- CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE FUTURE
  * A config script for generating neccessary info in /src/scripts/module.mk?
  * Java client? GUI OLC?

+-- KNOWN BUGS
  * Python accounts aren't dereferencing properly
  * Input handlers, specifically the editors, tend to output information
    twice when in a sub-menu such as the quest stage editor
  * Script dictionaries aren't fully dereferenced if a script creates a method.
    This is a known memory leak. Figure out how to fix!
 
+-- NOT COMPLETE
 +-- HIGH PRIORITY
   * make ch.get_slots and ch.get_slot_types congruent
   * expose set_val to Python
   * flesh out functionality of the file buffer
   * flexible color customization
   * make the script editor properly indent with /i and /e 
   * get_fullkey is dangerous, since it can be changed due to recursive calls.
     really really need to fix this.
   * give Python access to extra descriptions
   * expose races and extra descriptions to Python
   * Make OLC display which fields are inherited
   * make dates of logs print numerically, not as a string 
   * Allow NPCs and objects to have commands attached to them. Possibly with
     some sort of "to" or "with" command to call upon them?
   * let generic_find accept comma-separated names (e.g. tom, jerry, bob)
   * track last command
   * redo communicate() and logging. Allow log messages to go to different
     user groups (i.e. script errors to scriptors, bad zone loads to builders) 
   * make property tables auto-enlarge theirselves when they get too big 
   * scripts for zone initialization/reset
   * worldGetRoom and worldPutRoom should be part of utils, not world
   * redo sets to be in a tree form rather than a table form
   * Rewrite character positions to be string-based and extensible

 +-- LOW PRIORITY
   * Snoop module
   * IP banning module
   * mudFTP module
   * soft-code chat channels
   * spellchecking in the text editor
   * stackable objects
   * mountable characters
   * OLC for mud settings
   * Rewrite MCCP as its own module

+-- NEEDS DEBUGGING
