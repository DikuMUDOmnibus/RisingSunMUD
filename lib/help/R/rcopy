  usage: rcopy <from> <to> <times>
  
  This command can be used to create instanced rooms from a prototype, up to a 
  specified number of times.  For instance, if you have a template for all rooms 
  on main street (e.g., mainstreet@zone), instead of manually having to create 
  the 10 rooms on mainstreet, you can use the rcopy command to make instanced 
  rooms that all inherit from mainstreet.  For example: 
  
   > rcopy mainstreet mainstreet 10
  
  Will create rooms: mainstreet01, mainstreet02, ..., mainstreet03, all
  non-abstract, and all inheriting from the mainstreet prototype.
