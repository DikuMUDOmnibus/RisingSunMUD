  There are 9 fields assocciated with social editing; two are for messages when
  the social has no target. Two are for messages when the target is the character
  performing the social. Three are for situations when a target other than the
  character is provided for the social. The remaining two are the minimum and
  maximum positions the socials can be used from. If a social is not to have a
  target, the "target" fields can be left blank. Likewise, if the social is never
  to have the character as a target, the assocciated fields can be left blank.
  When trying to reference character information, the following symbols can be
  used:
  
    $n character name
    $N target name
    $e character he/she
    $E target he/she
    $m character him/her
    $M target him/her
    $s character his/hers
    $S target his/hers
  
  To see examples of how to write socials, check some of the pre-existing ones.
  To generate a list of all socials, type "socials".
  
  If you would like more than one command to trigger the same social, you can
  link a new command to a pre-existing social. Likewise, if you would like to
  disable a social command, that is possible too.
