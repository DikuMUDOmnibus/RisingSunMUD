keywords  : hedit, hdelete
info      :~
  usage: hedit <helpfile>
  usage: hdelete <helpfile>
  
  These two commands are used for adding and removing helpfiles from the MUD.
  Once you enter the help editor, you can set priviledges for viewing helpfiles,
  as well as linking other keywords to them (e.g., you could have entries for
  combat, death, sword, and kill all link to the same combat helpfile). Of
  course, hdelete will delete a help file, and all keywords linking to that
  helpfile.
