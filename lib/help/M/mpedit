  usage: <command> <person | place | thing>
  
  The scripter's analogue to medit, oedit, and redit. Opens up the raw script
  for the person, place, or thing, that can be edited directly rather than
  having to go through the builder interface. {cWARNING:{n the OLC interface
  is very finnicky about formatting, and if the proper commenting syntax and
  indentation is not adhered to, it may break OLC's ability to read in generation
  scripts.
