Welcome to the NakedMud tutorial. This collection of documents is intended to be
a comprehensive introduction to all aspects of the codebase. What this is not
is an introduction to programming, or a style guide for building. If you do not
have a rudimentary understanding of the relevant programming language, or a
basic understanding of how to plan a mud zone, this should not be your
destination for learning how to use NakedMud.
<p></p>
What this tutorial will provide is knowledge about the NakedMud codebase, and
how it can be used effectively. The tutorial is split up into two levels
(Basics, Extras), each with four different topics (Building, Scripting, Python,
C). The basics will provide a crash course on the major features NakedMud, in 
each of these areas. The Extras tutorials will walk readers step-by-step 
through the more complicated aspects of each area, with hints for efficiency and
caveats for design.
