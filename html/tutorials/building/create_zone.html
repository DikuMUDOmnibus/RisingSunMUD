The command for creating and editing existing zones is zedit. We will begin
by demonstrating how to create a new zone.

<div class="head">Editing a zone</div>
<div class="info">
Once a zone is created, it can be edited with the zedit command, simply by
not specifying that it is "new". When a zone is edited, a online creation (OLC)
interface appears for interacting with that zone.

The amount of editable fields for a zone are limited. Its name is simply what
it is called, for purposes of zlist. The description field is for record
keeping, about the purpose of the zone. This information will not be displayed
anywhere outside of the zedit command. Each zone can have any number of editors
associated with it. Zone editors are people who are allowed to use the edit
commands on contents for that zone. Any time multiple entries can be supplied
to a field, those entries are separated by commas.

<div class="head">Populating a zone</div>
<div class="info">
Zones largely contain an inter-connected series of rooms that can be populated 
by various mobiles and objects. When a zone is reset, all of its commands for
populating rooms are run. A zone with a reset timer will automatically reset
every n minutes. If n <= 0 is specified, a zone will never automatically reset.
Instead, it must be reset with the zreset command. There are also other
alternative ways of populating zones (e.g., with scripts that trigger when
players enter rooms, or talk to NPCs). These methods will be discussed in the
tutorial on scripting basics.
<p></p>
If a room has a reset command, it must be added to the resettable rooms list.
The main way to do this is through the room editing interface directly. However,
it can also be performed through the zedit interface. Simply select the
resettable rooms option and add the room key to the list. Room keys can also
be deleted from the this via this option.

It is highly suggested that resettable rooms are specified through the room
edit (redit) interface. However, specifying them through the zedit interface
can have its uses -- especially when attempting to figure out why certain
objects or mobiles are mysteriously loading or not loading.
