<div class="head">Creating Content</div>
<div class="info">
Rooms, objects, and mobiles all have editing functions (redit, oedit, medit).
If a key is specified, that content's information is brought up in the online
editing tool. If the key does not exist, new content is created for the key.
All content share some generic fields: inheritants, names, keywords, and
descriptions. Most fields should be straightforward, and so will not be
explained in detail. Inheritance 
and abstractness are covered in the "extras" tutorial. A few of the finer
points of content creation will be covered here: extra descriptions, item
types, and attaching triggers.
</div>

<div class="head">Attaching triggers</div>
<div class="info">
Rooms, mobiles, and objects can have scripts attach to them that are run when
certain events occur -- entering rooms, wearing removing, or picking up an 
item, resetting a zone, hearing something said, and so on. Each content editing
interface should have a T option. When the option is entered, a new interface 
for attaching and detaching triggers will become visible.

This simple trigger  deletes all objects that are dropped into a room. Its script is:
<pre class="code">
me.send(obj.name + " dissolves after it is dropped.")
extract(obj)
</pre>
Triggers are extremely flexible, and allow for scripted behavior in a wide
variety of circumstances. Their creation is covered in the tutorials on 
scripting. For now, suffice to say they can be attached to mobiles, objects,
and rooms through their respective OLC interfaces.
</div>

<div class="head">Extra descriptions</div>
<div class="info">
Rooms and objects can have extra descriptions attached to them. Extra
descriptions are additional blocks of text about the content that can be
accessed when particular aspects of the object or room are looked at. The Extra
description editor is accessed via the X option in OLC. 
<p></p>
When an extra description is created or edited, two fields can be changed. Its
keywords, and its description. The description is what is seen when viewed, and
the keywords are what can be looked at to present the description.

<div class="head">Item types</div>
<div class="info">
When an item is first created, it is just a descriptive lump. Objects have no
inherent functionality, only appearance. However, objects can be given 
(multiple) types. When an item gains a type, it gains functionality. Portals, 
weapons, wands, clothing. In the object OLC, the type menu can be brought up 
with the 'I' option. When this happens, a list of item types will appear:
<pre class="mud">
Editable item types:
  container          furniture          portal            worn          

    E) edit type
    D) delete type

Enter choice, ? [topic] for help, or Q to quit: 
</pre>
Each item type will have its own options to edit when selected. Note that each
item can have multiple types. Your throne can be a piece of furniture, but it
might also have a hidden compartment and act as a container for small objects.
