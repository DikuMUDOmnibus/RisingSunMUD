<div class="head">Changing content keys</div>
<div class="info">
It is not uncommon for a builder to have to change the keys for various zone
contents. Perhaps a spelling mistake is made, or on a larger scale, a builder
has made mainstreet01 to mainstreet09, but has decided they would like to
add an extra five rooms in the middle. Or maybe, a better key for content
has simply come to mind. For these circumstances, it is possible to change the
key of a zone content. Rooms, objects, mobiles, and triggers can have their
keys changed with the rrename, orename, mrename, and trename commands,
respectively. To change a key, you must first specify its current key and then
the new key you would like to use. For instance:
<pre class="mud">
> <font class="cmd">rrename town_square old_town_square</font>
town_square rproto renamed to old_town_square.
town_square reset does not exist.
</pre>
Rooms, objects, mobiles, and triggers will all display the first line of this
command. Additionally, rooms will automatically try to carry over their reset
commands with them (if available). Now, the content that was previously
referenced by town_square is referenced by old_town_square
<pre class="mud">
> <font class="cmd">goto old_town_square</font>
[old_town_square@moonhaven] [City] Town Square
Town square is actually more circular than anything.  The street is composed of
fine cobblestones, in a spiral pattern.  In the center of the square is a large
fountain.  The streets are surprisingly busy, even at night.  People are 
milling about, with the occasional friendly duel gathering a crowd.
  north      :: [merchant_street01@moonhaven] Merchant Street

  south      :: [merchant_street04@moonhaven] Merchant Street
  west       :: [mainstreet01@moonhaven] Main Street
A large fountain is here, bubbling in the center of the square.

<div class="head">Deleting content keys</div>
<div class="info">
Sometimes zone content is no longer needed. In such cases, it can be deleted.
Each type of content has its own delete function. You guessed it: rdelete,
mdelete, odelete, and tdelete. Notably, zones <i>cannot</i> be deleted from
within the mud. A player with shell access must edit the mud's lib/world/
directory and delete the zone folder manually.
